# Result Jackson Module

When using [Result objects][RESULT_REPO] with [Jackson][JACKSON_REPO] we might run into some problems. The
[Jackson datatype module for Result][RESULT_JACKSON_REPO] solves them by making Jackson treat results as if they were
ordinary objects.

> [Jackson][JACKSON_REPO] is a Java library for [JSON] parsing and generation. It is widely used for converting Java
> objects to JSON and vice versa, making it essential for handling data in web services and RESTful APIs.


## How to Use this Add-On

Add this Maven dependency to your build:

- **Group ID**: `com.leakyabstractions`
- **Artifact ID**: `result-jackson`
- **Version**: `{{ site.current_version }}`

[Maven Central][ARTIFACTS] provides snippets for different build tools to declare this dependency.


## Test Scenario

Let's start by creating a class `ApiResponse` containing one ordinary and one `Result` field.

```java
{% include_relative result-jackson/src/test/java/example/ApiResponse.java %}
```


## Problem Overview

Then we will take a look at what happens when we try to serialize and deserialize `ApiResponse` objects.


## Serialization Problem

Now, let's instantiate an `ApiResponse` object.

```java
{% include_relative result-jackson/src/test/java/example/Fragments.java fragment="instantiate" %}
```

And finally, let's try serializing it using an [object mapper][OBJECT_MAPPER].

```java
{% include_relative result-jackson/src/test/java/example/Fragments.java fragment="serialize" %}
```

We'll see that now we get an `InvalidDefinitionException`.

```
{% include_relative result-jackson/src/test/resources/serialization_error.txt %}
```

While this may look strange, it's the expected behavior. When Jackson examined the result object, it invoked
[`Result::getSuccess`][RESULT_GET_SUCCESS] and received an optional string value. But Jackson will not handle JDK 8
datatypes like `Optional` unless you register [the appropriate modules][JACKSON_JAVA8_REPO].

```java
{% include_relative result-jackson/src/test/java/example/Example_Test.java test="serialization_problem" %}
```

This is Jackson's default serialization behavior. But we'd like to serialize the `result` field like this:

```json
{% include_relative result-jackson/src/test/resources/expected_serialized_result.json %}
```


## Deserialization Problem

Now, let's reverse our previous example, this time trying to deserialize a JSON object into an `ApiResponse`.

```java
{% include_relative result-jackson/src/test/java/example/Fragments.java fragment="deserialize" %}
```

We'll see that we get another `InvalidDefinitionException`. Let's inspect the stack trace.

```
{% include_relative result-jackson/src/test/resources/deserialization_error.txt %}
```

This behavior again makes sense. Essentially, Jackson cannot create new result objects because `Result` is an interface,
not a concrete type.

```java
{% include_relative result-jackson/src/test/java/example/Example_Test.java test="deserialization_problem" %}
```


## Solution Implementation

What we want, is for Jackson to treat `Result` values as JSON objects that contain either a `success` or a `failure`
value. Fortunately, there's a Jackson module that can solve this problem.


### Registering the Jackson Datatype Module for Result

Once we have added Result-Jackson as a dependency, all we need to do is register `ResultModule` with our object mapper.

```java
{% include_relative result-jackson/src/test/java/example/Fragments.java fragment="register_manually" %}
```

Alternatively, you can also make Jackson auto-discover the module.

```java
{% include_relative result-jackson/src/test/java/example/Fragments.java fragment="register_automatically" %}
```

Regardless of the chosen registration mechanism, once the module is registered all functionality is available for all
normal Jackson operations.


## Serializing Results

Now, let's try and serialize our `ApiResponse` object again:

```java
{% include_relative result-jackson/src/test/java/example/Example_Test.java test="serialize_successful_result" %}
```

If we look at the serialized response, we'll see that this time the `result` field contains a null `failure` value and a
non-null `success` value:

```json
{% include_relative result-jackson/src/test/resources/serialization_solution_successful_result.json %}
```

Next, we can try serializing a failed result.

```java
{% include_relative result-jackson/src/test/java/example/Example_Test.java test="serialize_failed_result" %}
```

We can verify that the serialized response contains a non-null `failure` value and a null `success` value.

```json
{% include_relative result-jackson/src/test/resources/serialization_solution_failed_result.json %}
```


## Deserializing Results

Now, let's repeat our tests for deserialization. If we read our `ApiResponse` again, we'll see that we no longer get an
`InvalidDefinitionException`.

```java
{% include_relative result-jackson/src/test/java/example/Example_Test.java test="deserialize_successful_result" %}
```

Finally, let's repeat the test again, this time with a failed result. We'll see that yet again we don't get an
exception, and in fact, have a failed result.

```java
{% include_relative result-jackson/src/test/java/example/Example_Test.java test="deserialize_failed_result" %}
```


## Conclusion

You have learned how to use results with [Jackson][JACKSON_REPO] without any problems by leveraging the
[Jackson datatype module for Result][RESULT_JACKSON_REPO], demonstrating how it enables Jackson to treat Result objects
as ordinary fields.
